# Observer Pattern for Real-time News Subscription Service
Welcome to my GitHub repository for a simple implementation of a Real-time News Subscription Service using the Observer Pattern. In this README, I'll provide a brief overview of the Observer Pattern and how it's applied in this project.

# What is the Observer Pattern?

The Observer Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that establishes a one-to-many dependency between objects, where changes in one object (the subject or publisher) result in the automatic notification and update of all dependent objects (observers or subscribers).

# Real-time News Subscription Service

The goal is to design a real-time news subscription service for a media company. The system needs to notify subscribers about breaking news as soon as it's published by the news agency.

# Class Definitions:
Subject: an object that maintains a list of its dependents, also known as observers, and provides methods to add or remove observers. The subject notifies its observers automatically whenever its state changes.

Observer: an object that is notified and updated by the subject whenever the state of the subject changes.

# Implementation of Real-time News Subscription Service
In this project, I've applied the Observer Pattern to create a Real-time News Subscription Service. With this implementation, the clients can easily subscribe and unsubscribe in various services.

# Benefits of the Observer Design Pattern

This pattern promotes loose coupling between objects, as the subject doesn't need to know the specific details of its observers, only that they implement a common interface. It allows for a more dynamic relationship where many objects can observe a single subject, and any changes in the subject trigger updates in all connected observers.

The Observer pattern is useful when there is a need to maintain consistency between related objects or when a change in one object should trigger changes in other objects without coupling them tightly together. Some examples of where the Observer pattern might be used include monitoring changes in a model-view-controller (MVC) architecture, handling events in graphical user interfaces, or managing stock prices in financial applications.
