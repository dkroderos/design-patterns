## Introduction

Design patterns are essential tools for software developers to create well-structured, maintainable, and flexible code. This repository aims to provide practical examples and explanations of design patterns, helping you understand when and how to use them in your own projects.

## Design Patterns

Here's a list of design patterns included in this repository:

1. [Singleton](/singleton): Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
2. [Factory Method](/factory-pattern): Defines an interface for creating an object, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
3. [Builder](/builder): Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.
4. [Observer](/observer): Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, ensuring that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
5. [Strategy](/strategy): Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
6. [Decorator](/decorator): Allows you to attach additional responsibilities to objects dynamically.
7. [Command](/command-pattern): Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.
8. [Adapter](/adapter): Allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface.
9. [Composite](/composite): Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
10. [State](/state): Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.

Each design pattern has its dedicated directory with example code in various programming languages. Explore these directories to learn more about each design pattern's implementation.

- Each design pattern has its own directory named after the pattern.
- Inside each pattern directory, you'll find subdirectories for different programming languages, each containing code examples.
- A README.md file in each pattern directory provides detailed explanations and instructions for using the design pattern.

## Getting Started

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Choose a design pattern from the list above.
2. Navigate to the pattern's directory.
3. Select your preferred programming language.
4. Review the example code and accompanying README.md file for guidance on using the design pattern in your projects.
5. Incorporate the design pattern into your codebase as needed.
